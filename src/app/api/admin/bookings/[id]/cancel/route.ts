/**
 * Support's manual cancel-and-refund action. Reuses cancelBookingAndRefund
 * (src/lib/bookingCancellation.ts) - the exact same Stripe refund, status
 * update, cancellation emails, and PMS push the guest-facing cancel route
 * triggers - rather than a second implementation of any of that. The only
 * thing unique to this route is who's allowed to call it (ADMIN only, any
 * PENDING/CONFIRMED booking - not gated by the guest-facing
 * "can I still cancel this myself" window in canCancelBooking) and the
 * reason/optional refund override support provides.
 *
 * Audit trail: this codebase has no generic admin-action/changelog table
 * today (see PaymentDispute/BookingChangeRequest - each existing history
 * table is purpose-built for its own feature, not a general-purpose log),
 * and adding one is explicitly out of scope here (product-strategy.md's
 * anti-gold-plating stance, and schema.prisma is off-limits for this task
 * to avoid migration conflicts with the parallel suspend/unsuspend work).
 * So the minimal note taken is a structured server log line recording who
 * cancelled what, why, and what refund was actually applied - visible in
 * this deployment's server logs, and a real persisted audit log is a
 * reasonable near-term addition once schema changes aren't contended.
