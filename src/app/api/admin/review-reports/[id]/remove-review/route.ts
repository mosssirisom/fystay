/**
 * An admin upholding a report: the reported review is taken down
 * (Review.status -> REMOVED, which every public read path already filters
 * out - see src/lib/reviews.ts and every listing/search/wishlist/home
 * query) and this report is marked ACTIONED.
 *
 * A review can carry more than one report (@@unique([reviewId, reporterId])
 * only stops the same guest reporting it twice, not different guests each
 * reporting it once). Once the review is gone, any of its OTHER still-OPEN
 * reports are moved to ACTIONED in the same transaction too, rather than
 * left OPEN forever: there's nothing left for an admin to decide on them
 * (the outcome they were asking for already happened) and dismissing them
 * would misrepresent that as "not actionable" when it was, in fact, acted
 * on - just via a different reporter's report on the same review.
