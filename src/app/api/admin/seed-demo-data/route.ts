/**
 * One-off: populates the demo host/guest/listings/reviews/trip-extras
 * dataset (the same content prisma/seed.ts uses for local dev) through
 * the app's own already-configured DATABASE_URL, for an environment
 * nobody has a direct database connection to.
 *
 * Gated by a shared secret (SEED_ADMIN_SECRET) rather than an ADMIN
 * session, since a freshly-provisioned database has no admin account to
 * sign in as yet - this is meant to be the very first write against it.
 * Fails closed if the env var isn't set, rather than falling open.
 *
 * GET (not just POST) so this can be triggered by visiting a URL - the
 * one time this app accepts a state-changing GET, matching the same
 * pragmatic pattern as an email-verification link, since the whole point
 * is a single manual trigger with nothing else able to reach this path
 * without the secret.
 *
 * Safe to call more than once - every write it makes is idempotent (see
 * src/lib/demoSeed.ts), so a repeat call just reports what already
 * existed instead of duplicating rows.
