 * Nightly background sync for every CONNECTED PmsConnection - see

 * connection's mapped rooms in sync even for a provider with no webhook
 * support at all (SiteMinder/SuperControl today), and it's also what a
 * webhook-supporting provider falls back to for anything its webhook
 * delivery missed or this app couldn't verify. The host-triggered "Sync
 * now" button (POST /api/host/pms/connections/[provider]/sync) covers the
 * immediate case; this is what runs even if nobody presses it. One
 * connection failing outright (bad credentials, the PMS down) is logged
 * and skipped, not fatal to every other host's sync in the same run -
 * same resilience pattern as sync-ical-imports.
