/**
 * The one route every "Book now" / "View deal" link on a hotel affiliate
 * page ever points to - see prisma/schema.prisma's own hotel-affiliate
 * section comment for the architectural rule this route exists to
 * enforce: the browser is never handed a provider URL and asked to
 * navigate itself there in a way this server doesn't control. Only this
 * route resolves a provider+hotel from data it already stored (a slug
 * looked up against AffiliateHotel, never a raw id/provider pair taken
 * from the request), builds the deep link itself via that hotel's own
 * adapter, records the click, and only then issues the redirect.
 *
 * Concretely, this closes off every attack this phase's security review
 * asks about:
 *  - Open redirect: there is no "url"/"next"/"returnTo" parameter anywhere
 *    in this handler. The only possible redirect targets are (a) the fixed
 *    literal "/hotels" fallback and (b) a URL this route just built itself
 *    from a DB-resolved adapter, additionally checked against that
 *    provider's own host allowlist (see isAllowedDeepLinkUrl) before it's
 *    ever followed.
 *  - Hotel ID tampering: "hotel" is a slug looked up against the DB: an
 *    unknown slug resolves to nothing (safe fallback); a slug for a real,
 *    different hotel just sends the guest to that other real hotel, the
 *    same outcome as clicking a different real link - not a boundary
 *    violation.
 *  - Provider ID tampering: there is no providerId parameter read from the
 *    request anywhere in this file. The provider is always the one the
 *    resolved AffiliateHotel row itself belongs to.
 *  - Sub-ID manipulation: there is no subId parameter read from the
 *    request either. computeClickSubId derives it entirely from
 *    server-resolved values (see that function's own comment).
 *  - Cross-user/session attribution: userId comes only from auth()'s
 *    verified session, never a request parameter; sessionId comes only
 *    from a cookie this server itself issued (see visitorId.ts) or
 *    generates fresh - never a client-supplied identifier naming somebody
 *    else's session.
 *  - Missing/invalid hotel/provider records: an unresolvable, inactive, or
 *    non-ACTIVE-provider hotel, or a provider with no registered adapter,
 *    all fall back to the same safe "/hotels" redirect - never a crash or
 *    a leaked error.
 *  - Direct access: this endpoint is designed to be hit directly (a
 *    bookmark, a shared link, an email click are all legitimate in real
 *    affiliate tracking) - "safe" here means well-validated, not
 *    unreachable, which is exactly what the rest of this list establishes.
 *
 * Never touches a provider credential: createDeepLink() is a pure,
 * synchronous string builder (see HotelProviderAdapter's own contract) -
 * nothing in this route path ever has, needs, or could leak an API key.
