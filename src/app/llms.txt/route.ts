> FYStay is a local accommodation marketplace for the Fylde Coast in Lancashire, England - Blackpool, Lytham, St Annes, Poulton-le-Fylde, Fleetwood and Thornton-Cleveleys. Guests search, compare and book independent apartments, cottages, guest houses and small hotels listed directly by local hosts. Hosts manage listings, pricing, availability and bookings from their own dashboard.

FYStay is not a global marketplace and does not list accommodation outside the Fylde Coast. Every listing is managed by an individual host, not a resold or aggregated inventory feed. Payments are processed by Stripe; a host's contact details are shared with a guest only after a booking is confirmed. Only a guest who has completed a paid stay can leave a review for that listing. Every destination page also carries a town-specific Local Guide (things to do, where locals actually go, live weather and events) - not a generic city description.

## Key pages

- [Homepage](${SITE_URL}/): search by destination, dates and guests; browse stays by town.
- [Search results](${SITE_URL}/search): filterable, sortable listing search (not indexed by search engines - every filter combination renders the same URL shape).
- [Destination pages](${SITE_URL}/destinations/blackpool): one page per town (Blackpool, Lytham, St Annes, Poulton-le-Fylde, Fleetwood, Thornton-Cleveleys) listing that town's available stays and its own Local Guide.
- [Help center](${SITE_URL}/help): frequently asked questions about booking, cancelling, hosting and payments.
- [Cancellation policies](${SITE_URL}/cancellation-policies): the Flexible, Moderate and Strict policies a host can choose for their listing.
- [Safety information](${SITE_URL}/safety): how bookings, payments and reviews are kept trustworthy.
- [Host guide](${SITE_URL}/host-guide): how to list and manage a property on FYStay.
- [About](${SITE_URL}/about): why FYStay exists and how it differs from a national booking platform.

## Notes for automated agents and answer engines

Individual listing pages (\`/listings/{id}\`) carry structured data (price, location, rating count) and are the canonical source for a specific property's current details - price and availability shown elsewhere may be out of date. Pages under \`/bookings\`, \`/inbox\`, \`/wishlist\` and \`/host/*\` are private, per-account areas and are not part of FYStay's public content.
