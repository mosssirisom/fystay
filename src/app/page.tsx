          container so it spans the entire viewport width. Purely a video
          moment - no rotating real-listing photo or caption here (that's
          what the search results and destination pages are for), so
          nothing on this section depends on the catalog having listings
          in it.

          Deliberately no overflow-hidden here: the video itself is
          already clipped to this box by its own object-cover (see
          HeroBanner), so this section doesn't need to clip anything to
          look right closed. But the search bar's date/guest popovers open
          downward and are taller than the sliver of room left below the
          bar - clipping the section would cut those panels off (confirmed
          on a real phone) instead of letting them float over the page
          content below, which is normal, expected dropdown behaviour. */}
      {/* -mt-[75px]/lg:-mt-[74px] pulls this section up underneath the
          navbar at every breakpoint (previously lg:-only, with a plain
          positive margin below lg instead - the navbar itself used to
          stay opaque and in-flow there, so nothing needed to overlap; now
          that it's transparent everywhere too, the hero needs to sit
          behind it everywhere too) - see NavbarChrome's own comment on why
          that's a negative margin on this sibling rather than making the
          nav position:absolute (which would ignore the cookie consent
          banner's flow height and overlap it). 75px/74px match that
          navbar's actual rendered height at each breakpoint (measured
          directly, not a round-number guess - it comes out ~1px different
          below lg because of the mobile icon-button layout vs. the
          desktop logo/links layout) - if the navbar's own padding/content
          ever changes height, this needs to move with it.

          h-[100svh] on desktop (small viewport height, not dvh - a hero
          shouldn't resize itself while the user is mid-scroll as mobile
          browser chrome collapses) - the negative margin above already
          cancels out the navbar's own in-flow height, so this makes the
          video fill exactly the first screenful on a laptop/desktop
          instead of stopping short of the fold. lg:max-h-[860px] stops it
          growing unbounded on a very tall desktop window.

          Below lg, shorter on purpose (h-[62svh], not 100svh): on a phone
          the full-height version left literally nothing else on screen at
          first load - the "Hand-picked stays" carousel started well past
          the fold. 62svh keeps the hero exactly as designed (same video,
          logo, search bar and "Now covering" row, just less of the open
          sky above them) while leaving enough of the screen for that
          carousel's heading and a row of cards to already be visible
          without scrolling. min-h-[480px] is the floor for the shortest
          real phones (a landscape phone, or a small-screen device) so the
          search bar and pills never get cramped. */}

            beach still read at full strength. A held plateau (0-50%) at
            full opacity, not a fade starting at 0% - a straight two-stop
            linear-gradient (an earlier version of this) is already
            substantially faded by the time it reaches the middle of its
            own range, which put the subcopy's second line - sitting well
            inside what looked like "the opaque zone" on paper - over the
            pier's own crossbeams at only ~10% scrim opacity, unreadable.

            bottom offset and horizontal padding) so no corner of the
            card ever touches the video's own frame - rather than the
            earlier full-bleed band this replaced.

            Leaves room below it (bottom-28/sm:bottom-32, not the old
            bottom-3/sm:bottom-4 hugging the very edge) for the "Now
            covering" pill row now living in-hero at every breakpoint - see
            below - rather than in its own separate section after the
            hero, which is what used to make this bar tolerate sitting
            right at the bottom edge.

            Raised from bottom-24/sm:bottom-28 by the same 16px the pill
            row below was pushed up by (to clear the hero-to-page blend's
            own curve, see that row's comment) - moving only the pill row
            would have closed this gap by that same 16px instead, so both
            move together to keep it the width it was.

            lg: moves up further still and switches from centered-on-
            viewport to left-aligned within the same max-w-6xl/px-6

            which read as a separate, lower-effort afterthought instead of
            part of the same premium video moment the search bar is in.

            Styling matches the reference the user shared: a champagne-gold
            accent (the label flanked by hairline rules, and a plain pin
            icon per pill in the same gold) against outlined, glassy pills
            rather than the solid white badges this used to be - the
            outlined treatment reads as sitting *in* the video rather than
            floating a light card on top of it.

            A single scrolling line at every width below lg, not wrapping
            to multiple rows at sm: (an earlier version of this did) - this
            block is anchored to the hero's bottom edge and grows upward as
            its own content gets taller, so a two-row wrap at tablet width
            pushed the "Now covering" label up far enough to collide with
            the search bar sitting right above it. A fixed single-line
            height keeps the gap between them predictable at every
            breakpoint down here.

            bottom-8/sm:bottom-10 (not bottom-4/bottom-6, this row's
            original offset from before the hero-to-page blend below
            existed) leaves clear headroom above the cream section's own
            -mt-5/-mt-6 rise - otherwise the two edges land within a few

      {/* Rounded top + a small negative margin pulls this section up over
          the hero's own last few pixels, instead of the two meeting in a
          hard rectangular line - reads as one continuous page (a sheet
          rising over the video) rather than a video banner bolted onto a
          separate page below it. relative z-50 is required, not
          decorative: this div is a plain static sibling of the hero
          <section>, and everything inside that section is absolutely
          positioned with its own z-index (up to z-40, the search bar) -
          without a higher z-index of its own here, those layers would
          paint on top of this rounded edge instead of tucking behind it,
          even though they come earlier in the DOM. The overlap amount is
          deliberately small (and smaller again at lg: the desktop "Now
          covering" row is a plain text line, not a pill block, so it
          sits closer to the hero's true bottom edge than the mobile/
          tablet pill row does) so it never actually covers them, just
          softens the seam beneath.

          pb-8 only, not the pt-8/sm:pt-10 this used to also carry - that
          top padding existed to leave room for the "Now covering" strip
          that used to open this section; now that it lives inside the
          hero instead (see above), "Hand-picked stays" own mt-10 just
          below is the only top spacing this section needs. */}
