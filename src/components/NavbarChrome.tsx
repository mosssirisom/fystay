 * page wants the normal opaque, sticky bar this site has always had.
 * Splitting this out into its own client component - rather than making
 * the whole (server, session-fetching) Navbar a client component - keeps
 * that data fetch on the server while still letting the chrome react to
 * the route.

          // covering" pills), which paint over it. "relative" with no
          // offset keeps the exact same in-flow box as "static" but lets
          // z-50 genuinely apply, so the open dropdown always wins against
          // every hero layer (max z-40) without changing layout.
