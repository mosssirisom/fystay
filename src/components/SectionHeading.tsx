          reaches this h2's own computed style. A font-semibold class on
          this span would set its own 600 right back, which the browser
          then has no real 600 glyphs for and synthesizes (the "chunky,
          uneven" look that override exists to prevent) - so this just
          inherits the h2's true weight like every other heading does. */}
