 * call into a third-party provider, since no GA/PostHog/Segment key exists
 * anywhere in this app yet. Swapping in a real provider later means adding
 * one more send inside track() below, not restructuring every call site.
 *
 * `category` is deliberately a plain string (an ExtraCategory value today,
 * but never typed as that enum) so a future add-on category - or a
 * completely different kind of cross-sell - never needs this file, the API
 * route, or the DB schema to change to start recording events.

/** The events this phase's brief asks for, plus room to grow: any string
 * is accepted by trackAddonEvent, this union just gives the known ones
 * autocomplete and typo-safety at call sites. `transfer_intent_added` and
 * `transfer_added` are deliberately separate names, not the same event
 * fired from two places - the former is a pre-checkout click with no
 * money moved yet (TransferStepCard's "Add airport transfer" button,
 * fired client-side), the latter only ever fires server-side once a
 * purchase actually completes (see the extras route's own comment) -
 * merging them would conflate clicks with real revenue in any future
 * report built on this data. */
