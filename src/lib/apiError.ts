/**
 * Wraps an API route handler so an *unexpected* thrown error - a bug, a
 * Prisma failure that isn't already caught, a downstream API outage -
 * is logged and reported to Sentry, then turned into a generic 500
 * instead of either crashing the function or leaking an internal error
 * message/stack to the client.
 *
 * This is not a replacement for a route's own explicit error responses
 * (400 for bad input, 401/403 for auth, 404, 409 for conflicts, etc.) -
 * every route in this codebase already returns those directly and should
 * keep doing so. This only exists to give the *unhandled* case a single,
 * consistent, observable behavior instead of each route needing its own
 * top-level try/catch.
 *
 * Sentry.captureException is a no-op when SENTRY_DSN isn't set (see
 * src/instrumentation.ts) - same dev-mode-fallback pattern as every other
 * integration in this codebase.
