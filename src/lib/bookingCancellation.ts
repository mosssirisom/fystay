/**
 * The single place a booking is actually cancelled and (if it was paid for)
 * refunded - shared by the guest-initiated cancel route
 * (src/app/api/bookings/[id]/cancel/route.ts) and the admin manual-cancel
 * route (src/app/api/admin/bookings/[id]/cancel/route.ts), so there is only
 * ever one implementation of "what does cancelling this booking actually
 * do": recompute the refund via previewCancellation (never trust a refund
 * amount from a request body), issue the Stripe refund (Connect-aware, same
 * as the original charge), update the booking's status/paymentStatus, and -
 * only for a booking that had actually reached CONFIRMED, exactly like the
 * pre-existing guest flow - send the cancellation emails and push the
 * cancellation to any connected PMS.
 *
 * refundPercentOverride is the one behavioral difference the admin route
 * needs: a support-chosen flat refund percentage instead of the listing's
 * own cancellation-policy tiers. Every other caller omits it and gets the
 * exact same policy-driven refund the guest-facing flow always has.
