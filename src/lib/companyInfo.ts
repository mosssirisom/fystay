/**
 * The trading entity's legal identity - name, company number (if
 * incorporated), and registered/business address. UK law (Companies Act
 * 2006 for a limited company; the Ecommerce Regulations 2002 for any
 * trader) requires this to be disclosed on a site taking real bookings and
 * payments, and this codebase has no way to know it on its own.
 *
 * Deliberately env-driven and all-or-nothing rather than a hardcoded
 * placeholder: this app deploys straight to production on every push (see
 * README), so a literal "[FILL IN YOUR COMPANY NUMBER]" string would be
 * live in front of real guests the moment this shipped. Until every field
 * is set, getCompanyInfo() returns null and callers render nothing - the
 * same "don't show a guest a broken placeholder, degrade to absent
 * instead" pattern this codebase already uses for Stripe/Resend/Supabase
 * being unconfigured.
