/**
 * The Fylde Coast towns FYStay covers - the same set as the homepage's
 * "Now covering" badges. Backs both the homepage's "Explore the Fylde
 * Coast" tiles and the dedicated /destinations/[slug] landing pages (e.g.
 * /destinations/blackpool, targeting searches like "accommodation in
 * Blackpool"), so both read from one list rather than re-deriving it.
 * `searchCity` is the exact `city` value used elsewhere (seed data, search
 * filtering) so a tile or landing page genuinely filters to that town's
 * listings, not a placeholder link.
 *
 * Lytham and St Annes get separate entries rather than one combined
 * "Lytham St Annes" - they're two distinct towns with their own high
 * street, station and character (see localGuide.ts), and a Local Guide
 * written for both at once inevitably flattens into generic "the area"
 * copy. Poulton-le-Fylde is the sixth: not a seaside town at all, but the
 * coast's rail interchange and its market square is worth a stay in its
 * own right - see its own Local Guide entry for why that's a real
 * distinction FYStay makes rather than padding the list.
