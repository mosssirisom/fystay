/**
 * The provider-agnostic contract every hotel affiliate integration
 * implements (see src/lib/hotelProviders/providers/*.ts) - the search
 * route, hotel detail page, and click/deep-link route (once built in
 * Phases 5-7) only ever call through this interface via the registry
 * (src/lib/hotelProviders/registry.ts), never a specific provider's SDK or
 * endpoint shapes directly. Adding Expedia or HBX/Hotelbeds later is one
 * new file implementing HotelProviderAdapter plus one line in the
 * registry - never a change to the frontend, the database schema, or any
 * other provider's file.
 *
 * Same PmsAdapter precedent as src/lib/pms/types.ts, but for a
 * fundamentally different direction: PMS pulls a host's own inventory
 * into FYStay. This searches a third party's inventory that FYStay never
 * stores as its own and never takes payment for - every method here is
 * read-only against the provider, plus one pure string-building method
 * (createDeepLink) that never calls out anywhere.
 *
 * Deliberately no trackClick() method: recording a click is FYStay's own
 * database write (an AffiliateClick row), not something any provider's
 * API does on FYStay's behalf. Putting it on this interface would model a
 * capability providers don't actually expose.
