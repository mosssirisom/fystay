/**
 * The provider-agnostic contract every PMS/channel-manager integration
 * implements (see src/lib/pms/providers/*.ts). Nothing in src/lib/pms/sync.ts
 * or the API routes under src/app/api/host/pms/ ever imports a specific
 * provider's SDK or knows its endpoint shapes - they only ever call through
 * this interface, so adding a fourth provider later never touches the core
 * sync logic, only adds one more file implementing PmsAdapter and one line
 * in the registry (src/lib/pms/registry.ts).
 *
 * Direction of sync, matching how a PMS/channel manager actually works:
 * the PMS is the master of inventory, rates and restrictions (FYStay pulls
 * them in - see getAvailability/getRates/getRestrictions), while a booking
 * made *through FYStay* is what gets pushed out (createReservation) so the
 * PMS's own inventory count reflects it too. A reservation already on the
 * PMS's side (booked directly, or through another channel) is pulled in as
 * a blocking event via listReservations - it never becomes a FYStay
 * Booking, only an AvailabilityBlock (see src/lib/pms/sync.ts).
