 * own process memory, so an in-process counter would reset on every cold
 * start and wouldn't actually stop anything, let alone agree across
 * concurrent instances. The upsert below is a single atomic statement (one
 * row, one round trip): two concurrent requests for the same key can't both
 * read a stale count and both be let through, the way a separate
 * read-then-write would allow.
 *
 * A window "resets" the first time it's hit after windowMs has elapsed
 * since it started, rather than on a wall-clock boundary - simpler than a
 * sliding log, and precise enough for abuse protection on a handful of
 * auth-adjacent endpoints.
