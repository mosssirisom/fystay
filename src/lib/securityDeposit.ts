// A card authorization hold (Stripe PaymentIntent with capture_method:
// "manual") only stays valid for about a week before most card networks
// release it automatically, regardless of what FYStay's own records say.
// That's the constraint everything below is built around:
//
// - The hold is placed shortly BEFORE check-in, not at the time of the
//   original booking payment. A stay booked months in advance would
//   otherwise have its hold silently expire long before the guest ever
//   arrives.
// - The claim window after checkout is kept short enough that
//   authorization + stay + claim window comfortably fits inside that
//   same real-world hold lifetime for a short stay.
//
// This means a security deposit is only reliably enforceable for stays up
// to roughly DEPOSIT_AUTHORIZATION_WINDOW_DAYS + DEPOSIT_CLAIM_WINDOW_DAYS
// nights - for a much longer stay, the hold can expire before the claim
// window even opens. That's a real limitation of card authorization holds
// themselves, not something this app papers over: it's surfaced to hosts
// on the listing form rather than silently promising a guarantee it can't
// keep for long stays.
